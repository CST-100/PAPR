# DIY Positive Air Pressure Respirator 
### What is a PAPR?

A PAPR is a positive air pressure respirator that works by supplying clean air to the user in such a way that more air is supplied than is used so external contaminants don't get in.
They're particulalrly useful in the case of smoke or contagions as all the input air is heavily filtered before being delivierd to the user.

But most are quite expensive so we wanted to design our own!

This repo contains all of the files you need to recreate our design and adapt it to work with many types of commercially availiable filters and helmets. 

V3 is the most up to date and functional version. V4 is still under development.

## Procedure:

Building your own PAPR is easy and can even be done as a beginner project. You will need quite a few parts and tools, some of which you'll need to buy yourself, and others you can 3D print or buy online. The person who originally modeled the 3D printable PAPR files also sells kits on their site, [here.](https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/Inventability)

However, if you're buying either a partial kit or all the parts by yourself, here's everything you will need. If buying a partial kit, make sure you don't accidentally buy anything you already have.

This procedure also specifically is for the version using 3M filters. Much of it will be similar for Honeywell North users, however, you'll need a different version of some of the 3D printed files. Also, while Amazon.com links will be included, they are not affiliate links nor sponsored, merely ones that are known to work.

### Parts List:
**Electronics and fasteners:**
*Note: Sizes listed for screws are the maximum that can fit. Using smaller screws is a good idea if you plan to take yours apart frequently or cannot find larger ones. If you have to use US Standard sizes for screws, replace M3 with #4.*
- Voltage regulator: 2x [MT3608 voltage boosters](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0778KCV6V/) 
- Fans: 2x [75x75x30mm blower fan](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072HJ38PS/)
- A 20mm switch and [Micro-USB breakout](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0183KF7TM/) of some kind, power-only at this time.
- 9 M3x30 self-tapping, flathead screws (or shorter) to hold the top and bottom shells together.
- 20 M3x15 self-tapping, flathead screws (or shorter) to hold the fan-filter connector to the bottom shell.
- 8 M3x8 screws to hold the fan-CPAP connector to the bottom shell. Technically, six of these can be up to 10mm, but on the top-left of each connector, the screw would collide with one of the fan-filter screws.

**Of the 3D printed parts:**
- 1 Bottom Shell
- 1 Top Shell
- 2 "Fans to Filter" 
- 2 "Fan to CPAP connector"
- 2 "90 degree connector"
