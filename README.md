# DIY PAPR

*Forked from thethoughtemporium/PAPR*

TO DO:
- build a functioning one first
- organize things
- **120VAC tethering** - allow use of 120V power via a suitably long cord for "tethering" purposes, especially in office/school scenarios where sitting still for a long time in front of others in a closed environment. Would allow the system to operate independently of batteries, or even charge said batteries if applicable. 240 should also be under consideration.
- Possible HUD using transparent LCDs? Information such as outside air temperature, battery voltage, etc. May not be immediately possible due to the tiny distance between eyes and visor, but worth being looked in to. Another possible solution would be a tiny screen, 7 segment or LCD, at the bottom of the wearer's field of view with such information.
- Audio system, while current one is workable, microphones on left-right may be useful along with small speakers in helmet to either double as headphones or to augment hearing
- Onboard camera? Due to political "climate", one may be a good idea.

### What is a PAPR?

A PAPR is a positive air pressure respirator that works by supplying clean air to the user in such a way that more air is supplied than is used so external contaminants don't get in.
They're particulalrly useful in the case of smoke or contagions as all the input air is heavily filtered before being delivierd to the user.

But most are quite expensive so we wanted to design our own!

This repo contains all of the files you need to recreate our design and adapt it to work with many types of commercially availiable filters and helmets. 

V3 is the most up to date and functional version. V4 is still under development.
