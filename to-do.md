TO DO:
- build a functioning one first
- organize things
- **120VAC tethering** - allow use of 120V power via a suitably long cord for "tethering" purposes, especially in office/school scenarios where sitting still for a long time in front of others in a closed environment. Would allow the system to operate independently of batteries, or even charge said batteries if applicable. 240 should also be under consideration.

For helmet users:
- Possible HUD using transparent LCDs? Information such as outside air temperature, battery voltage, etc. May not be immediately possible due to the tiny distance between eyes and visor, but worth being looked in to. Another possible solution would be a tiny screen, 7 segment or LCD, at the bottom of the wearer's field of view with such information.
- Audio system, while current one is workable, microphones on left-right may be useful along with small speakers in helmet to either double as headphones or to augment hearing (This is *especially* useful in phone calls and other situations where while to a human, you may be audible, a microphone would struggle to pick you up)
- Onboard camera? Due to political "climate", one may be a good idea.
