# DIY Positive Air Pressure Respirator 

### Parts List:
**Original parts:**
*Note: Sizes listed for screws are the maximum that can fit. Using smaller screws is a good idea if you plan to take yours apart frequently or cannot find larger ones. If you have to use US Standard sizes for screws, replace M3 with #4. I'm personally testing #4 screws and will update on whether they work.*
- Voltage regulator: 2x MT3608 
- Fans: 2x 75x75x30mm blower fan
- A 20mm switch and Micro-USB port of some kind, power-only at this time.
- 9 M3x30 self-tapping, flathead screws (or shorter) to hold the top and bottom shells together.
- 20 M3x15 self-tapping, flathead screws (or shorter) to hold the fan-filter connector to the bottom shell.
- 8 M3x7 screws to hold the fan-CPAP connector to the bottom shell. Technically, six of these can be up to 10mm, but on the top-left of each connector, the screw would collide with one of the fan-filter screws.

**Of the 3D printed parts:**
- 1 Bottom Shell
- 1 Top Shell
- 2 "Fans to Filter" 
- 2 "Fan to CPAP connector"
- 2 "90 degree connector"

### What is a PAPR?

A PAPR is a positive air pressure respirator that works by supplying clean air to the user in such a way that more air is supplied than is used so external contaminants don't get in.
They're particulalrly useful in the case of smoke or contagions as all the input air is heavily filtered before being delivierd to the user.

But most are quite expensive so we wanted to design our own!

This repo contains all of the files you need to recreate our design and adapt it to work with many types of commercially availiable filters and helmets. 

V3 is the most up to date and functional version. V4 is still under development.
